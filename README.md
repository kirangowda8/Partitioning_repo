Data partitioning in databases like PostgreSQL helps optimize performance by splitting large tables into smaller, manageable parts based on specific criteria, such as ranges or lists. In Spring Boot, this can be handled by configuring appropriate partitioning strategies in the database schema and writing repository logic to interact with the partitions. This approach improves query performance and ensures better scalability for large datasets
